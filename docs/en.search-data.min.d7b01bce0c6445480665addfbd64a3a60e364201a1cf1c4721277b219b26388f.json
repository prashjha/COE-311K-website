We will also get to know the team including myself and the teaching assistants.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/COE-311K-website/docs/syllabus/policies/","title":"Policies","section":"Syllabus","content":"Class Format #  Classes will be taught with 3 one-hour lectures per week. Homework assignments will be given regularly.\nClass Schedule #  The topics will be covered in the order listed below with the amount of time spent on each topic subject to the progress of the class. In addition to the class lectures, two out of class exams will be given along with the final exam. Exam 1: Week of October 14th Exam 2: Week of November 4th Final Exam: Tuesday, December 17, 9:00-12:00 noon\nClass Outline #   MATLAB Basics (Chapters 2-3) Sources of Error (Chapter 4) Linear Systems of Equations (Chapters 8-11) Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (Chapter 13) Nonlinear Equations / Root Solving (Chapters 5-6) Introduction to Statistics (Chapter 14) Data Approximation and Interpolation (Chapters 14-18) Numerical Integration (Chapters 19-20) Numerical Differentiation (Chapter 21) Solving Differential Equations (Chapters 22-24)  Grading #  Homework: 35% (Each assignment might not be weighted the same)\nExams: 20% each (40%)\nFinal Exam/Project: 25%\nNote that attendance is not considered in a student’s final grade; however, regular attendance is expected.\nHomework Policy #  There will be approximately 10 homework assignments in the semester (8-12). Students will be given a minimum of a week to complete each assignment. Assignments will be due before lecture begins and must be handed to the instructor (unless alternate arrangements have been made with the instructor). Any assignment not given directly to the instructor by the student will not be accepted. Any assignment not turned in before lecture begins will be considered late. Assignments can be turned in up to 4 days late with a loss of an additional 20% for each day the assignment is late. No exceptions to the homework policy will be made without prior instructor approval.\nStudents are expected to complete their assignments independently. Students are encouraged to discuss general class topics amongst themselves; however, any sharing of code or plagiarism will be considered an act of academic dishonesty and will be dealt with severely under the Code of Conduct of the university. In addition, it is expected that students make an effort to produce organized and professional looking assignments.\nExaminations #  The class will consist of two in-class exams and a final exam according to the schedule given previously. The in-class exams will cover the topics immediately preceding the exam. The final exam will focus on the topics covered since the last exam but will also have a cumulative component. If you have a conflict with any of the in-class exams, you must notify the instructor immediately. Examinations will cover material discussed in class and homework.\nAttendance #  Regular attendance is expected. Students are responsible for information covered in class.\nOffice Hours #  Office hours will be listed after considering the best time for students. Additionally, appointments can be made with the instructor via e-mail.\nImportant Dates #  Aug 25: Classes begin.\nSpecial Notes #  The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TDD or the College of Engineering Director of Students with Disabilities at 471-4321.\nEvaluation #  Note that the Measurement and Evaluation Center forms for the Cockrell School of Engineering will be used during the last week of class to evaluate the course and the instructor. You may also want to note any other methods of evaluation you plan to employ.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/COE-311K-website/docs/lectures/","title":"Lectures","section":"Docs","content":"Lectures #  Lectures, hopefully, will be face-to-face. Since we will do some coding and also little bit of theory, the lectures will be delivered with a mix of presentation and handwritten notes. The notes and slides will be available in the github repository of this course.\nOn the right-side of website, you can find the list of lectures. The list will be updated as we move further in the course.\n"}]
